						<p>Welcome to my first blog post. This has been a long time coming. This will probably be a
							collection of fleeting
							thoughts, my perspective on various topics, and brain dumps when I feel like I have too much
							on my mind. For one reason
							or another, I have been putting off starting a blog - may it be because when I start
							spending more than a couple of
							minutes thinking about the idea, I realize it may not be worth my time or because I think no
							one will gain anything from
							this other than myself. And you know what - that’s okay. Because yes - right now, I could be
							writing unit tests, and
							maybe I should be. But sometimes, the best things in life come from acting on something you
							“have a good feeling about,”
							as my friend Anand likes saying.
						</p>

						<p>
							Today’s topic is relationships. I am your classic social butterfly. People know me as the
							guy who knows everyone. If a
							friend wants to learn about someone they don’t know too well - they reach out to me as a
							point of reference. I state
							this not as a flex. This is a byproduct of something I love doing - socializing. However,
							this love of meeting as many
							people as possible has come to my detriment. For as long as I can remember, I have been
							everyone’s friend. In ninth
							grade, after becoming class Vice President, I felt the need to be everyone’s friend and
							uphold a professional standard
							more than ever. This meant I tried not to become too close with the friends I made and ran
							away from romantic
							relationships. I didn’t want to publicly display affection or have a falling out with anyone
							- only for the drama that
							would ensue afterward to jeopardize my chances of being nominated for an officer position
							the following year or for my
							fellow classmates to respect me less for something that was out of my control. And since
							then - for better or worse,
							that’s been how I have socialized. One might have said I was a “floater.”
						</p>

						<p>
							When I left my charter school for TAMS in 10th grade, that was the end of most of those
							charter school relationships -
							relationships I had kindled over the seven years I was at the school through extracurricular
							sports, class leadership
							organizations, and more. When I came to TAMS, my priorities changed. In the weeks leading up
							to my first semester at
							TAMS, I would have nightmares about failing. I had no idea what to expect - all I knew was I
							would be in a school with
							some of the brightest kids in Texas. When I got to TAMS, gone was the priority of upholding
							a professional standard, and
							in was the desire to maintain a 4.0 so I could survive TAMS and hopefully make it to a good
							college. And once again, I
							thought I’d be a floater. But this time, I didn’t want to be. I wanted to find that group I
							vibed with.
						</p>

						<p>
							However, just in the first week during Fall Orientation, it seemed like many of the kids
							from Houston, and Dallas knew
							each other, and there were pre-established cliques. I’m not saying I couldn’t integrate
							myself into one of these groups
							- it was more than the things they talked about, and their extracurricular interests were
							not aligned with the
							opportunities I had access to at my former school. Honestly, this was probably a bs excuse -
							but to some degree, I felt
							like the effort I would have to put in to integrate myself as one of the members of these
							groups wouldn’t be worth it,
							especially since the people within these groups had been friends with each other for several
							years.
						</p>

						<p>
							Even then - my two years at TAMS turned out much better than I initially expected. The “TAMS
							Experience,” as many call
							that two-year period was 110% worth it and was undoubtedly the best two years of my life.
							However, when it came to my
							social life, although I tried not to be a floater and wasn’t for my first year there,
							eventually, the group that I
							thought was my group crumbled due to drama and breakups (note: I was usually the mediator
							and most of this drama was
							unrelated to me lol). Once again, in my senior year, I became a floater. At that point, with
							college apps and all the
							random things that take up one’s time in senior year of high school, I could care less and
							made it through - focused on
							that 4.0.
						</p>

						<p>
							Fast forward two years and some to today, and I’m less of a floater today - partially
							because I have actively pushed not
							to be one every semester. But this has led to another issue. As someone who strongly
							believes in the philosophy that
							relationships can be broken within the time it takes one to snap their fingers but take
							years of work to maintain, I’ve
							found it incredibly difficult to let go of relationships (note: most of these relationships
							are referring to platonic
							relationships) - even ones where I’ve seen the potential but it’s been a one-sided thing.
							Relationships are a two-way
							street - obviously. But when I think back to all of the moments that have made those
							relationships (in my opinion)
							strong, it’s hard to let go of them. It’s frustrating to think all of that was for nothing.
							As I scroll through
							Instagram and come across college graduation or wedding reels, I start thinking about life’s
							biggest moments and wonder
							who I would invite to such occasions as every few months, it seems like my closest friends
							become a different set of
							people (with some outliers who are the real ones haha).
						</p>

						<p>
							While I still enjoy meeting as many people as possible, I’ve realized I want to deprioritize
							my drive to network and
							connect with every person in the world and prioritize investing in building deep, meaningful
							relationships.
							Relationships with those with whom I can share my highest and lowest moments - as I’ve
							realized that those moments don’t
							hold much value if I’m not able to share them with people I care about. Relationships with
							those with whom I want to
							take crazy, spontaneous trips worldwide. Relationships with those with whom I don’t mind
							staying FaceTiming till the
							sunrise because we have so much in common but can also talk for hours about the most random
							things.
						</p>

						<p>
							So at the end of the day, I’ve realized that being a floater isn’t all that bad. Being a
							floater is a transitory phase -
							maybe one of introspection, as I drop what I thought were long-term relationships and find
							myself - something that may
							help me find my lifelong people or my next set of long-term relationships. Anyways, that’s a
							wrap for this one. See you
							the next time I reflect on some random aspect of my life - which, as it turns out, is pretty
							often.
