                            Welcome back to my second blog post! This - like the first blog post - has been a long time
                            coming. There have been so
                            many things I have wanted to write about. From week two of my internship at Tesla - when I
                            was feeling pressure ramping
                            up and wanted to discuss something - I don’t know what it was, but it was something deep and
                            insightful (or at least I
                            think it was). Likewise, as you’d imagine, I’ve learned a thing or two working at one of the
                            fastest-paced companies in
                            the industry and building some of the coolest things I’ve ever gotten the chance to work on,
                            but I think it would only
                            be fair to have another post dedicated to a reflection on my internship.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So the title of this post is Being Kind and Making Time. This has been an odd semester for
                            me as you can imagine - or
                            maybe you can’t because you don’t know that I’ve been working at Tesla full-time this
                            semester as a software engineer
                            intern and a part-time student (taking one business minor course). What’s really funny is
                            I’ve always idolized the idea
                            of a co-op or taking a semester off full-time. I thought, hey - wouldn’t it be cool to
                            leverage the fact that I can
                            graduate early to work for another company, gain some experience, and take advantage of all
                            of the other benefits that
                            come along with working for a company? And while working full-time as an SWE Intern has
                            helped me hone my software
                            development skills, it’s forced me to make changes in my life and has led to some
                            realizations about myself and life as
                            a whole.

                            Actually, to be fair, all of this probably isn’t so bad. I have a friend - a crazy one at
                            that - who decided to work
                            full time, take a full courseload of classes, and do all the other routine things of life,
                            and they made it out alive
                            (barely). And I’m sure there are plenty of other people who can do the same. But so what?
                            Recently, I’ve realized it’s
                            okay to feel like I am unable to do everything I was able to when I wasn’t working full
                            time, even if it means my job
                            challenges my extrovertedness, which I take pride in. It’s okay if adulting and working
                            8-hour days tire me out, whereas
                            the other interns around me can work for 10 - 12 hours a day without getting fazed. It’s
                            okay if I don’t live up to the
                            expectations imposed upon me by my friends, organizations, and other individuals that may be
                            stressing me out.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The old me would have eaten myself up for being “complacent” about not solving these issues.
                            But what’s really
                            interesting is when you physically don’t have the time to take on these extra
                            responsibilities or tasks - you have to
                            back down. As they say, time is the great equalizer. And you see, that’s when things become
                            interesting. For the last
                            several weeks, I have been frustrated about the fact that when I finish the week, I
                            oftentimes have not reached to
                            friend so and so, have not hit this many leetcode problems, and a consequently unprepared
                            for my interview the following
                            week, have not updated my client for the group project on what we’ve done, want to use the
                            weekend to catch up on sleep,
                            and yet feel like I am behind on my project at work. However, I can also very peacefully
                            acknowledge all of these things
                            as facts, be kind to myself, and move on with the understanding that I’ve put my best foot
                            forward, and that’s all that
                            matters. Hmm, what a brilliantly simple concept, right - one that I’ve probably preached to
                            my friends a hundred times
                            then they’ve told me about how they worked their butt off but still didn’t reach their
                            desired result.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It’s all about perspective - mostly yours - that should dictate your life (preach Neal pt.
                            2). But really, I think if I
                            let go of some of the things that I think are making my life miserable - like the
                            potentially negative social perception
                            of me if I leave an organization or the fact that I am too tired to reach out to make plans
                            and may get labeled fake
                            across a subset of my friend group - everything will be fine. I will live. And probably not
                            burnout. LOL. That was a
                            pretty weird ending, but this was kind of a PSA, self-validation type piece and something I
                            wanted to write. Idk at this
                            point, it’s 2:30 a.m. and I haven’t proofread this. I probably won’t get around to typing my
                            annual custom Thanksgiving
                            messages to the 75-100 people I am thankful for, so if you are reading this, I am probably
                            thankful for you. I hope you
                            have/had a good Thanksgiving and get to spend it with the people you love. Cheers and
                            goodnight.
